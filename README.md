FOR ANYONE REVIEWING THIS CODE:
This C++ project starts from code given to us by Dr Rich Davison at Newcastle University. Naturally, I want to draw your attention to code I actually wrote rather than his (not that it isn't brilliant!). 

All the code in Renderer.h/cpp and SolarSystem.h/cpp is mine. 

Light.h is mostly written by me: the point light was supplied, but the rest is my own code. 

All shader code used by the project is either wholly mine, or heavily adapted by me. The 'heavily adapted' part refers to the rockShader, lightShader, reflectingShader and skyBox shader, because we were shown how Blinn-Phong shading and cube-mapping skyboxes is done
in tutorials, so I can't take full credit for that - but I did significantly change the code to support different types of lights (spot, directional, point), and multiple, interacting dynamic shadow-maps.
